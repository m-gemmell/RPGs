# Flat Packed Peril

This is a [monster of the week](https://evilhat.com/product/monster-of-the-week/) mystery. 
This mystery is heavily inspired by the Inifinite IKEA mystery with some major changes. 

The IKEA the hunters will be trapped in will be very large but not so infinite (yet).
There is a central object/monster (the ond )

## Basic concept of the mystery
Like infinite ikea SCP but on a much smaller scale.
Planned as an intro mission.
