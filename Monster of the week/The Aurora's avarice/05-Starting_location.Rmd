_Point of no return_

A large parking lot at the base of the mountain.
This is where all cars and other out of town transport stop.
Two of __Skyfry's Ski lifts__ largest vehicles are generally always waiting here, a E-minbus and an E-van.
One of the __Bjorkson brothers__ is in a small cabin waiting to use one or the other.

This is the first place the hunter's will arrive and so the first person they meet will be a Bjorkson brother.

As they travel up the winding road for an hour the first thing they will see of the town of Skifry is its town symbol on a welcome to sign.

If the hunters try to return to base camp before solving the mystery they will find the minibus & van have "broken down".
Unfortunately the normal Ski lift taxis can't make it down the steep road.
