To face down the snow worm the hunters will most likely have to traverse into the mountains.

## Ski slopes

_Den_: to harbour monsters.

Snowy and forested ski slopes.
This is most likely where the Snow worm will attack as it is close to town so the Bjorksons can easily use their drone from their compound.

## The mountains

_Maze_: To confuse and separate

The hunters will need to traverse the mountain wilderness to get to the cave of origins.
There are steep cliffs, forests, and various caves.

## Cave of origins

This cave is about an hour out of town via snowmobile if you know where to look.
It will probably take a while to find the place but shorter if they have a guide.

This is the cave where the snow worm eggs were found by the Bjorksons.

In this cave they can find the broken remains of 7 eggs (6 bjorksons who each ate an egg plus the living juvenile snow worm).

Feel free to add some clue as to how the snow worms got to earth here. 
An orange lemon by some petrified black roots in my case.
